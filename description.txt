[h1]Trencher[/h1]

Module-based trench generation.

You must save the mission for trench modifications to show up in-game.

The server and client both need this mod and its dependencies for it to work.

[H1]FEATURES:[/H1]
- Create trenches of any depth and width, with lots of configuration options
- Optionally add reinforcement to the trench walls, sandbags, dragons teeth and barbed wire
- Optimised for multiplayer performance
- Trench ends will smoothly blend with terrain
- Hides objects in trench path

[h1]Performance[/h1]
This mod is designed with multiplayer performance in mind:
- Everything except the barbed wire is a local simple object. This is the most simple type of object you can create in-game, and has zero network traffic.
- Simple objects also barely impact FPS compared to simulated objects, so you will find this mod performs way better than you'd expect.
- Data on how to create these objects is contained within the mission file itself, therefore the JIP queue is not spammed, nor is a ton of data transferred after mission start
- The exception to this is barbed wire, which must be simulated to be destroyable/cuttable. Barbed wire is only created on the server and Dynamic Simulation will be enabled on all barbed wire objects.
- Terrain modifications are also added to the JIP queue, can't avoid this.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
[b]Deformer[/b]
Semi-compatible - overlapping trenches and deformer modifications may result in one or both sets of changes getting applied.
To avoid issues just don't overlap Deformer and Trencher areas.
[b]Bucket: Zeus Terrain Editor[/b]
Fully compatible
[b]AI[/b]
AI will not cheat and walk through trench walls. They can only enter or exit trenches at actual entrances.
Unfortunately, AI cannot storm over the top of trenches.

[h1]How to use[/h1]
- Place a trench controller module in Eden
- Sync any number trench piece modules to each other and the controller module
- Modify settings using the module attributes of the controller module
- Save the mission for changes to take effect.

[h1]Known issues[/h1]
- Saving the mission is required to show changes in preview.
- Moving multiple modules at the same time is very laggy as each time you move a single piece it recalculates the entire trench. Each node move will do this. This can crash the editor, sorry!
- Creates large mission files.
- Can look kinda jank on maps with very large terrain grids (old maps like Sahrani).
